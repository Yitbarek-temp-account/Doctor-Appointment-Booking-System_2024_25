The Project Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of planning, executing, and managing projects within organizations. This system allows team members to easily create, view, and manage project tasks and milestones, while enabling project managers to efficiently oversee project progress and resource allocation. Key features include user authentication, task assignment and tracking, project timeline visualization, and a user-friendly interface that enhances overall team collaboration. The application aims to reduce administrative burdens for project managers and improve productivity for teams working towards common goals.


## We choose MongoDB for our project over other relational databases because : 

  - Flexible Schema: MongoDB's document-oriented structure allows us to store data in a flexible format. This is particularly useful for handling diverse data types related to appointments,     patients, and doctors without the need for a fixed schema.
  - Scalability: As our application grows, MongoDB provides horizontal scaling capabilities, making it easier to handle increased data loads and user traffic.
  - Rich Querying: MongoDB supports powerful querying capabilities, allowing us to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data based on various criteria (e.g., finding available doctors, retrieving patient appointment history).
  - JSON-like Documents: The use of BSON (Binary JSON) format makes it easier to work with data structures that mirror the objects used in our application code.
