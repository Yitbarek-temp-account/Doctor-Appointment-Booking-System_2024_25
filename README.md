## We choose MongoDB for our project over other relational databases because : 

  - Flexible Schema: MongoDB's document-oriented structure allows us to store data in a flexible format. This is particularly useful for handling diverse data types related to appointments,     patients, and doctors without the need for a fixed schema.
  - Scalability: As our application grows, MongoDB provides horizontal scaling capabilities, making it easier to handle increased data loads and user traffic.
  - Rich Querying: MongoDB supports powerful querying capabilities, allowing us to efficiently retrieve and manipulate data based on various criteria (e.g., finding available doctors, retrieving patient appointment history).
  - JSON-like Documents: The use of BSON (Binary JSON) format makes it easier to work with data structures that mirror the objects used in our application code.
